		1) Hexapod - 1;
		2) Continuous servo motor - 1;
		3) LCD screen - 1;
		4) Dot matrix - 1;
		5) Ultrasonic sensor;
		6) Wires - unknown number;
		7) Connectors - unknwn number;
		8) Multisensor - 1;
		9) Light sensor - 1;
	       10) PIR sensor - 1;
	       11) Switch - 1;
	
Overview: 
	Our first goal is getting the hexapod moving correctly(as per our
	advisor's advice). Then we will brainstorm on how to solve tasks
	that were given to us by the topic. As we have not yet agreed on what
	the other 3 tasks might be. 
	Some suggestions by alexander:
	Using the ultrasonic sensor to detect how far away the sheet of
	paper/shape is from our Pi,
	Sentry mode - when deteting movement in an area, starts flashing
	lights, making sounds.
	Indoor weather monitor by multisensor - humidity, pressure, 
	temperature, altitude. (Janno didn't specify the exact size of the paper ;3)
