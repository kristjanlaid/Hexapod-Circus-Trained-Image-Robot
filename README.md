========================================

###Aim of the project:

* Our project aim is to make the HEXAPOD robot move properly by performing a complete dance routine while showing the appropriate lyrics over an LCD and display the light show on a dot matrix.

# Overview: 

	Our first goal is getting the hexapod moving correctly(as per our
	advisor's advice). Then we will brainstorm on how to solve tasks
	that were given to us by the topic. As we have not yet agreed on what
	the other 3 tasks might be.
	The next goal is to get an image of lyrics from an LCD. 
	Some suggestions by alexander:
	Using the ultrasonic sensor to detect how far away the sheet of
	paper/shape is from our Pi,
	Sentry mode - when deteting movement in an area, starts flashing
	lights, making sounds.
	Indoor weather monitor by multisensor - humidity, pressure, 
	temperature, altitude. (Janno didn't specify the exact size of the paper ;3)


### Problems:
 (*All of the problems, that we are going to face, will be added here during the practical session of the project)

# Schedule:

>** Week 10 ** (4 hours)

*Basically, adding the main project plan to the README.md file in the group repository.

>** Week 11 ** (4 hours)

*Filming a video about the concept of the project and all the possible challenges with solutions to them.

>** Week 12 ** (8 hours)

*Starting to practice on the practical part of the project, where we have to make our HEXAPOD robot move properly, by making it follow a given routine.

>** Week 13 ** (6 hours)

*Working with the components for. The robot, such as servo motor and writing the programme for them using python libraries.

>** Week 14 ** (6 hours)

*The main task is to make an LCD to show the appropriate lyrics on it.

>** Week 15 ** (6 hours)

*Task of week 15 for our group is to get a correct light show on a Dot matrix display.

>** Week 16 ** (6 hours)

*Final stage before the actual presentation of the project. Getting the final result by putting everything together and working on fixing any possible mistakes.

>** Week 17 **

*Project presentation.

**Total hours count: 40 hours. (As required)
